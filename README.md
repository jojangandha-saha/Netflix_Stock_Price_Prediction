## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging task that involves forecasting the future stock price based on historical data. In this project, we employ the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the stock price of Netflix. Linear Regression is a widely-used supervised machine learning technique that establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Dataset

For this project, we used a historical dataset of Netflix stock prices. The dataset contains various features like date, open price, high price, low price, close price, volume, etc. We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.0
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/jos7730/netflix-stock-prediction.git
```

2. Change the working directory:

```
cd netflix-stock-prediction
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed all the necessary packages. Then, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the dataset: Make sure the dataset is available and properly formatted.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert data types if needed, and perform any feature engineering required.

3. Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Model Selection: Choose Linear Regression as the predictive model.

5. Train the Model: Fit the model to the training data using cross-validation.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Linear Regression model to achieve better performance.

7. Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics on the test set.

8. Make Predictions: Utilize the trained model to predict future stock prices.

## Model Training

For model training, we use the Linear Regression algorithm. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (stock price) and predicts the target value based on the input features.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in optimizing the model's performance. We employ techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to find the best combination of hyperparameters for our Linear Regression model. By tuning hyperparameters, we aim to avoid overfitting and underfitting and improve generalization.

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, we calculate various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc. These metrics help us understand how well our model predicts the stock prices.

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements to enhance the stock price prediction model:

- Feature Engineering: Experiment with additional relevant features that could improve the model's accuracy.
- Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to capture complex patterns in the stock price data.
- Time Series Models: Consider using time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM, which are specifically designed for time-dependent data.
